//! Audio: pure DSP + timing (YIN pitch detection, the note gate, the SMF
//! encoder, the metronome clock) and the platform output seam.
//!
//! Ports `Sources/KeyInSight/Audio/`. The AVAudioEngine plumbing maps to
//! the [`AudioOut`] trait per `docs/platform-substitutions.md`: cpal on
//! native, WebAudio on WASM, silent in tests/headless (the Swift metronome
//! also kept its clock running when audio was unavailable).
